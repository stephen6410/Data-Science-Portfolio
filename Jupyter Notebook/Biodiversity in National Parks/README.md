### National Parks Service Biodiversity Data Analysis
---
**Examining different species observed in four major national parks, this project will answer:**
- How many of each taxonomic Class are in each conservation status?
- What percent of each Class is "declining"?
- Which species were most frequently observed?
- What is the rarest bird to spot at each park?
- Where are Canids most likely to be spotted?
